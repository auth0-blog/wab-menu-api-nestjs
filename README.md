# Developing a Secure API with NestJS

[Click here to read the full tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-a-secure-api-with-nestjs-adding-authentication/)

Learn how to **build a feature-complete API using NestJS** that lets clients perform data operations on resources that describe a restaurant menu. Using TypeScript with Node.js gives you access to optional static type-checking along with robust tooling for large apps and the latest ECMAScript features.

Learn also how to **define data models, create a data service, and quickly build modular endpoints**. As an option, you can also learn how to **secure the API using Auth0**. To see your API in action, youâ€™ll use a production client called "WHATABYTE Dashboard", which is inspired by the [sleek web player from Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/search).

## Setup

- Clone repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:auth0-blog/wab-menu-api-nestjs.git \
nest-restaurant-api \
```

- Make the project folder your current directory:

- Create a `.env` hidden file:

```bash
touch .env
```

- Populate `.env` with this:

```bash
PORT=7000
AUTH0_DOMAIN="Your Auth0 domain"
AUTH0_AUDIENCE="Your Auth0 audience"
```

npm run start:dev
```
